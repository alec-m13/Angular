This repo is for learning Angular. I plan to follow some tutorials and then build my own app. I already know what my app will be -- a topological Tic-Tac-Toe. It should be a fun game but let's not get into it now. First up some Angular tutorial stuff.

I'm getting the hang of my process here. I will make a wiki page for the setup, then the tutorial, then the project. I would rather get started than figure out app version control at the moment. Git does the raw version control already anyway.
